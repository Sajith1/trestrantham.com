## Hello. ##

My name is Tres Trantham. I'm a software developer, husband, father and all around technology geek.

I live in Florida with my amazing wife, Erin, and beautiful daughter, Penelope. We are accompanied by our two 
cats and miniature schnauzer, [Oliver](http://www.flickr.com/photos/trestrantham/4456535978 "Oliver").

I currently work in the banking and insurance realms as a technical consultant. I wear many hats ranging from 
ETL developer to Systems Analyst to SQL Guru. Check out my [resume](/resume) if you would like to know the nitty gritty.

My spare time is spent building web applications, enjoying good craft beer and other musings of general 
nerdery. I'm a strong advocate for usability and standards both on and off the web. I like simplicity in life 
and design. And I've crashed in a Piper Navaho twin-engine aircraft.

I can also be found on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/trestrantham "Twitter"), [Facebook](http://facebook.com/trestrantham "Facebook") 
and [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/trestrantham "Flickr"). If you want to contact me directly for any 
reason, please feel free to email [me@trestrantham.com](mailto:me@trestrantham.com).
