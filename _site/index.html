<p>My name is Tres Trantham. I'm a software developer, husband, father and all around technology geek.</p>

<p>I live in Florida with my amazing wife, Erin, and beautiful daughter, Penelope. We are accompanied by our two
cats and miniature schnauzer, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trestrantham/4456535978" title="Oliver">Oliver</a>.</p>

<p>I currently work in the banking and insurance realms as a technical consultant. I wear many hats ranging from
ETL developer to Systems Analyst to SQL Guru. Check out my <a href="/resume">resume</a> if you would like to know the nitty gritty.</p>

<p>My spare time is spent building web applications, enjoying good craft beer and other musings of general
nerdery. I'm a strong advocate for usability and standards both on and off the web. I like simplicity in life
and design. And I've crashed in a Piper Navaho twin-engine aircraft.</p>
